# Python-project

**PROJECT OBJECTIVE **
The objective of this project is to develop a simple, console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python, Riddle game, and question-answer game based on 
categories. The goal is to practice basic Python programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and user input handling.


## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive development)
- **random module** â€” to allow the computer to make random choices

## How to Run

1. Install **Python 3.x** and **Jupyter Notebook** if not already installed.
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run each cell in sequence.
4. Follow the console prompts to play the game.

**TASK 1:**
Write a program to develop a simple console-based computer brain teaser, a riddle logic puzzle, text-based puzzles involving wordplay, logic, and lateral thinking 
games in Python. The 
program will randomly choose a riddle question from a list of riddles (question-answer dictionary) provided in the program. It will then prompt the user for an 
answer and compare it against the correct answer. If the user's answer matches the correct one, the program will print 'Correct'. Otherwise, it will print 
'Incorrect' and provide the correct answer. The program will continue to run infinitely, allowing users to solve multiple riddles with the option to play again. 
Upon exiting the game, the program should display the user's score as a percentage. 


**TASK 2:**
Write a program to develop a simple console-based computer brain teaser, an arithmetic logic puzzle, a problem-solving game in Python The program will randomly 
generate two numeric numbers within the range of 1 to 20 and an arithmetic operator. The program will run infinite turns to solve the arithmetic puzzle with the 
option to play again. 
The program should handle exceptions gracefully, such as invalid inputs when the user attempts to solve the puzzle. The program should print the percentage of the 
score when the 
user leaves the game.  using python


**TASK 3:**
Write a Python program to develop a General Knowledge quiz game. Create four lists to store general knowledge questions of four categories: Science, Mathematics, 
Geography and others. Each item in these lists is a dictionary with "question" and "answer" keys, as provided in the upcoming slide. Ensure to include proper 
exception handling to handle invalid user inputs. The program should display questions based on the category selected by the user. After the user submits an 
answer, the program should indicate whether it is correct. If the answer provided by the user is incorrect, the program should display the correct answer. 
Create the following methods for game logic: 
Presents category options for the user to choose from
1.ask_question(question): Displays a given question and prompts the user for an answer. 
2.check answer(user answer, correct_answer): Compares the user's answer with the correct answer and provides feedback. 
3.display_score(questions, score): Prints a summary of the player's performance, including correct answers, total questions, and percentage of correct responses. 
4.exec_questions(questions): Iterates through a given set of questions, handles user interactions, and keeps track of the score _ 
Manages the main game loop, including category selection, question execution, and the option to play again. Incorporate exception handling to ensure the program 
gracefully handles invalid inputs and unexpected errors. 
Run the Program: 
The if name main ": block ensures code execution only when the program is run directly. 
Prints a welcome message. 
Calls the play_game() method to start the game. Prints a thank you message after the game concludes. 
Suppose 2 category is chosen by user, then a Mathematics based question should be displayed, such as 'What is the only 
even prime number? The user will provide their answer. 
If the answer is correct, the program should display: 'Correct' 
If the answer is incorrect, the program should display: 'Incorrect The correct answer is 2' 


**TASK 4:**
Think about how the rules of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game can be translated into Python code. Build the game using a Python program where Player 1 is the computer, 
making random choices 


**TASK 5:**
Develop a Python program to simulate a two-player Rock- Paper-Scissors game The program should prompt each player to enter their name; allow each player to choose 
rock; paper, or scissors, implement logic to determine the winner, and display the winner's name
